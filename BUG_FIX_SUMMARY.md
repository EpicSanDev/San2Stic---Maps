# Bug Fix Summary - San2Stic Maps

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Schema Error: "column followersCount does not exist"

**Problem**: Authentication was failing with database schema errors.

**Root Cause**: The database wasn't properly synced with the model definitions, causing missing columns.

**Solution**: 
- Ensured proper environment configuration with DATABASE_URL
- Verified force sync is working correctly in development
- Confirmed all User model fields including `followersCount` are created properly

**Files Changed**: 
- `backend/.env` (created)
- Database initialization process validated

### 2. API 500 Internal Server Error on /api/recordings

**Problem**: The recordings endpoint was returning 500 errors.

**Root Cause**: Environment configuration issues and authentication middleware inconsistencies.

**Solution**:
- Standardized authentication middleware across all routes
- Fixed environment configuration for proper database connection
- Verified all API endpoints respond correctly

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/src/routes/recordings.js`
- `backend/src/routes/users.js`

### 3. Missing Favicon (404 Error)

**Problem**: Frontend requests for favicon.ico were returning 404 errors.

**Solution**: Created a basic favicon.ico file in the frontend public directory.

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/public/favicon.ico` (created)

### 4. Authentication Middleware Inconsistency

**Problem**: Different routes were using different authentication middlewares (`authenticate` vs `authenticateToken`), causing potential issues.

**Root Cause**: Two different auth middleware files with different behaviors:
- `authMiddleware.js`: Sets `req.user` to decoded token only
- `auth.js`: Sets `req.user` to full user object from database

**Solution**: Standardized all routes to use `authenticateToken` from `auth.js` for consistent behavior.

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/src/routes/recordings.js`
- `backend/src/routes/users.js`

### 5. UUID Parsing Bug in Social Routes

**Problem**: Follow functionality was failing because the code was trying to parse UUID strings as integers.

**Root Cause**: `parseInt(req.params.id)` was being called on UUID values in follow/unfollow routes.

**Solution**: Removed `parseInt()` calls and used UUID strings directly.

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/src/routes/social.js`

## Testing Results

All critical functionality has been verified:

✅ Database sync with all required columns
✅ User registration and login  
✅ API endpoints returning correct responses
✅ Follow/unfollow functionality with proper followersCount updates
✅ Authentication working across all protected routes
✅ Frontend building successfully

## Configuration

For development, use these environment variables:

**Backend (.env)**:
```
NODE_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=sqlite::memory:
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=4000
```

**Frontend (.env)**:
```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

## Next Steps

The application is now fully functional. For production deployment:

1. Use a persistent PostgreSQL database instead of SQLite in-memory
2. Configure proper JWT secrets
3. Set up CORS origins appropriately
4. Configure production-grade logging and monitoring
