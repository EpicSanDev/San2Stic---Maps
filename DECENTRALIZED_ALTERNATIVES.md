# Decentralized Deployment Alternatives to Railway

This document outlines self-hosted and decentralized deployment options as alternatives to centralized cloud platforms like Railway.

## 🎯 Decentralized Deployment Philosophy

San2Stic prioritizes:
- **Data Sovereignty**: You control your data
- **Censorship Resistance**: Accessible via Tor hidden services  
- **Privacy First**: No third-party data collection
- **Decentralized Storage**: Files stored on IPFS network

## 🏠 Self-Hosted Options

### Option 1: VPS Deployment (Recommended)

Deploy on any VPS provider for 24/7 availability:

**Popular Providers:**
- DigitalOcean (Privacy-focused)
- Linode (Developer-friendly)
- Vultr (Global presence)
- Hetzner (Europe-based, privacy-focused)

**Deployment Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Setup VPS with Docker
ssh user@your-server
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sh get-docker.sh

# 2. Clone and deploy
git clone https://github.com/EpicSanDev/San2Stic---Maps.git
cd San2Stic---Maps
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env for your domain/IP
docker compose up -d
```

### Option 2: Home Server

Run on dedicated hardware at home:

**Hardware Requirements:**
- Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB+) or mini PC
- 64GB+ storage (SSD recommended)
- Stable internet connection
- Optional: UPS for power backup

**Setup:**
```bash
# Install Docker on Raspberry Pi
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Deploy San2Stic
git clone https://github.com/EpicSanDev/San2Stic---Maps.git
cd San2Stic---Maps
docker compose up -d
```

### Option 3: Decentralized Hosting

**IPFS Hosting:**
- Deploy static frontend to IPFS
- Use IPNS for updatable content
- Access via ENS domains or .eth names

**Tor-Only Deployment:**
- Hidden service only (no clearnet)
- Maximum privacy and anonymity
- Censorship resistant

## 🌐 Hybrid Deployments

### Frontend on IPFS + Backend Self-Hosted

1. **Build and deploy frontend to IPFS:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
# Add to IPFS
ipfs add -r build/
# Publish to IPNS
ipfs name publish /ipfs/{hash}
```

2. **Deploy backend on VPS:**
```bash
# Only backend services
docker compose up -d backend db redis icecast
```

3. **Update frontend API endpoints to your VPS**

### Multi-Node Deployment

Deploy across multiple servers for redundancy:

**Node 1 (Primary):**
- Backend API
- Database (primary)
- IPFS node

**Node 2 (Backup):**  
- Database replica
- IPFS node (pinning service)
- Monitoring

**Node 3 (CDN):**
- Frontend static files
- IPFS gateway
- Load balancer

## 🔐 Enhanced Privacy Setup

### Tor-Only Configuration

For maximum privacy, deploy as Tor hidden service only:

```yaml
# docker-compose.tor-only.yml
services:
  nginx:
    environment:
      - NGINX_MODE=tor-only
    # Remove external port mappings
    # ports: [] 
```

### VPN Integration

Combine with VPN for additional privacy:
- Deploy through VPN
- Route IPFS traffic through VPN
- Use VPN-friendly VPS providers

## 💰 Cost Comparison

| Option | Monthly Cost | Setup Time | Privacy Level |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| VPS (Basic) | $5-20 | 30 min | High |
| Home Server | $0 (after hardware) | 1-2 hours | Maximum |
| IPFS Only | $0-5 (pinning) | 15 min | High |
| Hybrid | $5-15 | 1 hour | Very High |

## 🔧 Migration from Railway

If migrating from Railway or similar platforms:

1. **Export data:**
```bash
# Backup database
pg_dump railway_db > backup.sql

# Download uploaded files
# (if using Railway's file storage)
```

2. **Setup new deployment:**
```bash
# Deploy to your chosen platform
git clone https://github.com/EpicSanDev/San2Stic---Maps.git
cd San2Stic---Maps
# Configure .env
docker compose up -d
```

3. **Restore data:**
```bash
# Restore database
docker compose exec db psql -U san2stic san2stic < backup.sql

# Upload files to IPFS
# Files are now content-addressed and distributed
```
